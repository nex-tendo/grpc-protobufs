# gRPC Protobufs
- gRPC protobuf definitions for Nextendo Network micro-services
- Original gRPC Protobufs [here](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/grpc-protobufs).

## Structure
- Each folder contains the protobuf definitions of the *server* intended to receive the requests. This means, for example, `account` contains protobuf files for requests to the account server.
